        <h2 class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>



<p>At Climate Ireland and our educational website Climate Ireland Learning, our main priority is the well-being and education of our students
and customers. It is of paramount importance to us that we do everything to
ensure that our students receive the most effective course materials from our
programmes. One of the means of ensuring that our students get the information
they need, in the most effective manner, is to view the visual journey that
they take through our site. This, mixed with certain profile information,
allows us to learn the in-site habits of our students. To do this, our website
collects aggregate data and information from our website. As a result, we can
offer a better user experience, better course materials, and better products.</p>



<p>Below is Climate Ireland Learning's Privacy policy. To make this content more readable, we have
broken it into sections as follows.</p>
